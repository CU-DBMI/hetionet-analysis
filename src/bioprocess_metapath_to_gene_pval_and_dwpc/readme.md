# Biological Process and Gene Metapath Data Gathering

- Each value from `BP.csv` is a source and each value from `Gene.csv` is a target. 
- Each source + target pairing may have a metapath which is found within `metapaths.csv`.
- For each pair metapath we need the DWPC and p-value stored in a table for reference.
- Ignore metapaths found within `metapaths_ignore.csv`.
